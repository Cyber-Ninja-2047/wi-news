    "1. split the document into sentences.\n",
    "2. build the dependency tree for each sentence.\n",
    "3. locate all of the non-stopword subject and object in the sentence, and their conjuncts, as our targets.\n",
    "4. for every target, extract modifiers from their child nodes recursively, then we have the subtree from the target.\n",
    "5. sort the subtree by tokens' positions and filter out the stopwords.\n",
    "6. cut the prefix modifiers for compound words (for example, \"security law\" is a unique compound word, we don't need the \"tough\" as its prefix).\n",
    "7. connect the sorted and filtered subtree as our keyword. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Special Rule for Verb Root\n",
    "\n",
    "The general extraction rule misses the information of the event itself. As an instance, if we apply the rules above on “John reads a book”, the extracted keywords are “John” and “book”. However, we have no idea about what John does for the book unless we include the event “reading”. This can be solved by compounding the direct object “book” and the verb’s gerund form “reading”. To be cautious, we only perform this special rule for the dependency root of a sentence, which is most promising to be the event.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try the these step on a more complex case.\n"
